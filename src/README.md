# Visualisation Source Code

This is the folder where you can make changes to the code, make sure you've read through the [project docs](../docs/README.md) for info on the structure of the project and how to add new visualisations.

There is more information on the implementation of the visualisations in the folders, or you can follow the links below:

1. [Scheduling](./scheduling/)
2. [Salt Curve](./salt-curve/)
3. [Traceability](./traceability/)

The `./index.html`, `./style.css` and `./script.js` files you see in this folder are for the front page of the site, so if you add a visualisation this needs to be changed manually in `./index.html`.
